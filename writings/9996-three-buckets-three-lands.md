# Three Buckets, Three Lands: Financial Strategy for Rooting in Uncertain Times

## Applying resilience economics to Verde Valley, Boise, and Monterey Bay

A companion to *Three Paths, Three Lands* and *The Digital Sage*

---

You have an inheritance coming. Or a windfall. Or you've saved carefully for years. Or you're selling a house in an expensive city and moving to cheaper ground. However the capital arrives, you now face a question that matters more than most financial advisors understand:

**How do you transform paper wealth into real wealth before the systems that give paper its value become unreliable?**

This is not a doomer question. This is a designer question. You're not planning for apocalypse; you're planning for *transition*. The shift from extractive to regenerative systems. From centralized fragility to distributed resilience. From individual survival to community thriving.

This essay applies the **Three-Bucket Strategy** to the three land paths we explored: Verde Valley's red rock clarity, Boise's mountain balance, and Monterey Bay's coastal beauty. It's a practical map for deploying capital toward a life that can weather what's coming while building what's needed.

---

## THE THREE-BUCKET STRATEGY: A Primer

Before we apply this to specific geographies, let's understand the framework.

### Bucket 1: Resilience Assets (40% of capital)

This is wealth that produces *real value* independent of financial markets:
- Land with water access
- Infrastructure (solar, wells, greenhouses, workshops)
- Tools and equipment that produce or maintain essentials
- Seed banks, food systems, community resources
- Structures owned in commons (land trusts, cooperatives)

**The goal**: Create a foundation that works even if money becomes unreliable.

### Bucket 2: Transition Capital (40% of capital)

This is wealth positioned to hold or grow value *during* transition:
- Renewable energy companies (established, revenue-generating)
- Water infrastructure investments
- Regenerative agriculture land (leased to good farmers)
- Essential materials (long-term holds, not speculation)
- Small allocation to decentralized systems (crypto, mesh networks)

**The goal**: Maintain optionality while systems shift. Not extraction, but strategic participation in the changing economy.

### Bucket 3: Living Expenses & Leverage (20% of capital)

This is liquid wealth for:
- Your modest living expenses
- Emergency support for people in crisis
- Opportunistic purchases when others panic-sell assets you need

**The goal**: Flexibility. The ability to act when timing matters.

### The Timeline

Transform paper wealth into real wealth over **10-15 years**, before paper wealth devalues significantly. This is not a weekend project. This is a patient, deliberate redesign of your relationship with capital.

## APPLYING THE STRATEGY: Three Geographies, Three Approaches

Each of the three land paths—Verde Valley, Boise, and Monterey Bay—offers different opportunities and constraints for deploying this strategy. Let's walk through each.

---

## PATH ONE: Verde Valley, Arizona
### Resilience Assets at Scale

**The Opportunity**

Verde Valley offers the most accessible path for building Bucket 1 at scale. Land is affordable enough that a moderate inheritance ($200K-$500K) can purchase significant acreage. Water exists (though it must be secured carefully). The climate allows year-round outdoor work. Permitting is relatively flexible.

This is the geography for people who want to *build* resilience infrastructure with their own hands or with a small community.

### Bucket 1: Resilience Assets (40%) — The Build

**Example Deployment: $400K Inheritance**

**Land Purchase**: $160K
- 40-80 acres of raw land with well potential in Cottonwood or Camp Verde area
- Prioritize: existing well, year-round road access, southern exposure, proximity to community

**Infrastructure Build**: $80K
- Off-grid solar system (10-15kW with battery storage): $30K
- Well drilling and development (if needed) or cistern system: $15K
- Small cabin or converted shipping container (permitted): $20K
- Greenhouse and veganic garden infrastructure: $8K
- Tool library basics (tractor, tools, workshop setup): $7K

**Community Commons**: $20K
- Contribution to land trust formation
- Shared seed bank and library
- Community water catchment system

**Total Bucket 1**: $260K (65% of inheritance — more than the standard 40% because land is so affordable here)

**Why This Works in Verde Valley**:
- You can actually afford to build what you need
- Climate allows solar to be primary energy source
- DIY culture means skilled helpers are available
- Permitting is manageable for off-grid systems
- Existing spiritual/intentional community networks to plug into

**The Risk**: Water. You MUST have a solid water plan. This might mean a producing well, proven water rights, or a sophisticated catchment system. Do not proceed without this solved.

### Bucket 2: Transition Capital (25%)

**Example Deployment**: $100K
- $40K: Shares in established solar companies (First Solar, Enphase—boring, revenue-generating)
- $20K: Water infrastructure ETF or direct ownership in water rights (carefully researched)
- $20K: Regenerative agriculture land elsewhere (leased to farmers) — possibly in Midwest where land is cheaper
- $10K: Copper and lithium long-term holds (physical or ETF)
- $10K: Bitcoin/Ethereum (small hedge on decentralized systems)

**Why This Mix**: You're living in a resilience-focused place, so your Bucket 2 can be more growth-oriented. These investments track the transition without requiring your daily attention.

### Bucket 3: Living & Leverage (15%)

**Example Deployment**: $60K
- $40K: 2-year living expenses (you can live VERY cheaply in Verde Valley if you're off-grid and growing food)
- $15K: Emergency fund for helping neighbors, opportunistic tool purchases
- $5K: True emergency cash

**The Verde Valley Advantage**: Low cost of living means this bucket stretches far.

### The Verde Valley Path: Summary

**Best for**: People with $200K-$500K who want to maximize Bucket 1, build with their hands, and live simply while being part of an intentional community.

**The trade-off**: You're going remote. You're building from scratch. You're accepting heat, isolation, and the constant question of water.

**The upside**: You can create a genuinely resilient homestead or micro-community for the price of a down payment on a house in most cities.

---

## PATH TWO: Boise, Idaho
### Balanced Deployment in a Growing Region

**The Opportunity**

Boise represents the middle path: more expensive than Verde Valley but cheaper than Monterey Bay, more infrastructure than Verde Valley but more room than Monterey Bay. This is the geography for people who want resilience *and* connection to a functioning city.

The challenge: Boise is rapidly gentrifying. You're competing with tech money fleeing California. You need to move decisively.

### Bucket 1: Resilience Assets (40%)

**Example Deployment: $600K Inheritance**

**Land Purchase**: $180K
- 5-20 acres within 30-45 minutes of Boise
- Prioritize: existing well, power available (or good solar potential), zoning that allows agriculture and dwelling
- Possible locations: outskirts of Eagle, rural Kuna, foothills properties (if you can find them)

**Infrastructure Build**: $60K
- Grid-tied solar with battery backup (prepared for grid failure): $35K
- Greenhouse with season extension (critical for Idaho winters): $10K
- Workshop and tool storage: $8K
- Veganic garden setup: $7K

**Community Investment**: $20K
- Join or start a community land trust
- Co-invest in shared equipment (tractor, chipper, tools)
- Contribute to regional seed bank

**Total Bucket 1**: $260K (43% — slightly higher than 40% to secure good land before prices rise further)

**Why This Works in Boise**:
- You get land within reach of a real city with services, healthcare, culture
- Four seasons make food preservation and storage critical (which you can learn)
- Growing network of homesteaders and resilience-focused people
- Access to University extension services, farmer networks
- Close enough to mountains for water security (relatively)

**The Risk**: Rapid price inflation. What's $180K today might be $250K in two years. You need to move fast.

### Bucket 2: Transition Capital (40%)

**Example Deployment**: $240K
- $80K: Renewable energy sector (diversified across solar, wind, battery tech)
- $50K: Water infrastructure and agricultural technology companies
- $50K: Regenerative agriculture land in Montana or Eastern Oregon (leased out)
- $30K: Essential materials (copper, lithium, rare earth ETFs)
- $20K: Regional credit union or community investment fund (support local resilience economy)
- $10K: Decentralized systems (crypto, mesh network tech)

**Why This Mix**: Boise is transitioning from conservative resource extraction to tech-forward sustainability. Your investments mirror that transition.

### Bucket 3: Living & Leverage (17%)

**Example Deployment**: $100K
- $60K: 18-month living expenses (Boise costs more than Verde Valley, less than Bay Area)
- $30K: Emergency fund for helping people, opportunistic land purchases
- $10K: Cash reserve

**The Boise Advantage**: You can live modestly but still have access to good food, healthcare, community, and culture. You're not isolated.

### The Boise Path: Summary

**Best for**: People with $400K-$800K who want a balance between resilience building and urban connection. Those who can handle winter and want access to outdoor recreation as a lifestyle component.

**The trade-off**: Higher costs than Verde Valley. Rapid gentrification creating competition and resentment. Political tension between state and city values.

**The upside**: You build resilience while keeping connection to culture, services, and a network of like-minded people in a functional city.

## PATH THREE: Monterey Bay / Carmel, California
### High-Cost Resilience and Community Investment

**The Opportunity**

Monterey Bay is the most expensive path, but it offers something the others don't: an established culture of environmental protection, regenerative agriculture, and progressive values. You're not building from scratch; you're joining and strengthening existing networks.

This is the geography for people with significant capital who want to deploy it in a place that's already doing the work.

### Bucket 1: Resilience Assets (35%)

**Example Deployment: $1.2M Inheritance**

**Land Purchase**: $300K
- This is tough. You're looking at:
  - A small parcel (1-3 acres) in Carmel Valley
  - Co-ownership of larger property with community partners
  - Land trust membership with use rights
  - Or: participation in existing community farm/land project

Reality check: You're not buying 100 acres here. You're buying *participation* in resilience infrastructure.

**Infrastructure Investment**: $80K
- Solar system for your small parcel or contribution to community solar
- Rainwater catchment (critical in drought-prone California)
- Greenhouse and intensive veganic garden
- Workshop space (likely shared)

**Community Commons**: $50K
- This is where Monterey Bay shines: invest in existing cooperatives
- Buy into community-supported agriculture (CSA) farms as member-owner
- Invest in the Homeless Garden Project or similar social enterprise
- Support regional seed libraries and tool shares
- Join Carmel Valley Village land trust initiatives

**Total Bucket 1**: $430K (36% — lower than other regions because land costs force more community-oriented approaches)

**Why This Works in Monterey Bay**:
- You're joining a mature network of regenerative practitioners
- Food culture is exceptional — access to local, organic, vegan food is easy
- Climate is gentle — year-round growing possible
- Strong environmental regulations protect the region long-term
- Existing infrastructure for resilience (farmers markets, co-ops, land trusts)

**The Risk**: Cost. Everything is expensive. Also, water restrictions during drought. Fire risk in inland valleys.

### Bucket 2: Transition Capital (45%)

**Example Deployment**: $540K
- $150K: Renewable energy sector (California leads this transition)
- $100K: Water technology and desalination companies (critical for California future)
- $100K: Regenerative agriculture land in California Central Valley (leased to organic farmers)
- $80K: Sustainable fisheries and aquaculture (you're on the coast!)
- $60K: Essential materials (long-term hold)
- $30K: California community investment funds (supporting local resilience businesses)
- $20K: Decentralized systems

**Why This Mix**: California is driving the renewable transition. Your investments are aligned with where the state is headed, which increases likelihood of returns that maintain value.

### Bucket 3: Living & Leverage (20%)

**Example Deployment**: $240K
- $150K: 2-year living expenses (Monterey Bay is expensive for food, housing, everything)
- $70K: Emergency fund and opportunistic investment capital
- $20K: Cash reserve

**The Monterey Bay Advantage**: You have access to exceptional culture, food, healthcare, and community while living in one of Earth's most beautiful places.

### The Monterey Bay Path: Summary

**Best for**: People with $800K-$2M+ who value established community, environmental culture, and mild climate over space and autonomy. Those who want to *join* rather than *build* resilience infrastructure.

**The trade-off**: Extremely high cost. Limited space. Heavy regulation. Crowding during tourist season.

**The upside**: You live in beauty, supported by mature networks of people doing regenerative work, in a region protected by strong environmental policy.

## CROSS-CUTTING STRATEGIES: Principles for All Three Paths

Regardless of which geography you choose, these principles apply:

### 1. Time Is Your Ally and Your Enemy

**Ally**: You have 10-15 years to make this transition thoughtfully. Don't rush foolishly.

**Enemy**: Paper wealth devalues as systems strain. Real assets (land, water, tools) appreciate. Don't wait too long.

**Strategy**: Move deliberately but decisively. Buy land in years 1-3. Build infrastructure in years 3-8. Shift Bucket 2 investments gradually as transition accelerates.

### 2. Community Is Non-Negotiable

Lone wolf homesteads fail. Hired security turns on you. Gated communities become targets.

**Strategy**: Whatever you build, build it with others or build it to be shared.

- Start or join a land trust
- Create cooperatives for tools, water, energy
- Invite skilled partners to co-own or co-steward
- Form legal structures that protect commons

### 3. Skills Matter More Than Stuff

Money can buy land and tools. It cannot buy the knowledge to use them well.

**Strategy**: Dedicate time and resources to learning.

- Take permaculture design courses
- Learn welding, carpentry, electrical work
- Study water systems, soil science, food preservation
- Build relationships with people who know what you don't

Budget for education: 5-10% of your total inheritance should go to skill-building (courses, apprenticeships, books, travel to learn from others).

### 4. Resilience Is Not Retreat

You're not building a bunker. You're building a *node* in a resilient network.

**Strategy**: Stay connected to the wider world.

- Maintain internet (Starlink if needed)
- Stay engaged with regional governance
- Build relationships with nearby towns
- Offer resources when crisis hits
- Teach what you learn

### 5. Your Lifestyle Must Be Modest

If you build a mansion on your land, you've failed. You're a target. You've also missed the point.

**Strategy**: Live simply, invest the difference.

- Small, efficient dwelling (500-1000 sq ft)
- Focus on functionality over luxury
- Quality tools over disposable stuff
- More time outdoors, less time consuming
- Hospitality over ostentation (guest space, shared meals, teaching)

---

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: What If You Don't Have a Large Inheritance?

This framework scales.

### With $50K-$100K:

- **Verde Valley**: Buy raw land ($20K-40K), start small with a shed or trailer, build slowly
- **Boise**: Buy land with partners, co-invest in community property
- **Monterey Bay**: Join a land trust, rent nearby, invest in community shares

Focus Bucket 1 on skills and tools rather than land. Bucket 2 on smaller investments. Bucket 3 on living expenses while you build income.

### With $10K-$50K:

- Focus on Bucket 3 (living expenses) and skills
- Buy hand tools, take courses, build relationships
- Save aggressively toward land purchase
- Consider working on someone else's resilience project in exchange for land access

### With Under $10K:

- Focus entirely on skills and relationships
- Offer labor on resilience projects in exchange for learning
- Build the network that will matter more than money
- Position yourself to be invaluable to future community

**The truth**: While capital helps enormously, the most valuable currency in transition times is **trustworthiness, skill, and commitment to mutual aid**. Start building that now, regardless of your bank account.

---

## THE TIMELINE: A 15-Year Transition Map

### Years 1-3: Research, Purchase, Foundation
- Deep research on geographies and communities
- Extended visits and relationship building
- Land purchase
- Basic infrastructure (dwelling, water, power)
- Bucket 2 investments initiated

### Years 4-8: Building, Learning, Deepening
- Major infrastructure build-out (greenhouses, workshops, gardens)
- Skill acquisition intensifies
- Community structures formalized (land trusts, co-ops)
- Bucket 2 rebalanced as markets shift
- Teaching begins (share what you've learned)

### Years 9-15: Maturity, Generosity, Adaptation
- Systems are productive and largely self-maintaining
- Focus shifts from building to stewarding
- More time for teaching, mentoring, community support
- Bucket 2 continues to fund operations and expansion
- Bucket 3 deployed for helping others in crisis
- Adaptation to whatever transition is actually happening

### Year 15+: Living the Design
- You are on resilient land, in community, with skills and resources
- Paper wealth has been transformed into real wealth
- You are positioned to weather shocks and support others
- You are doing the work that matters

## CONCLUSION: From Paper to Place

The financial advice that dominates our culture—max out index funds, live off dividends, buy luxuries—assumes continuity. It assumes the systems that give money its value will persist unchanged.

You know better.

The Three-Bucket Strategy is not about fear. It's about **redesign**. It's about recognizing that the transition from extractive to regenerative systems is already underway, and positioning yourself to participate in building what comes next.

Whether you choose Verde Valley's affordable spaciousness, Boise's balanced access, or Monterey Bay's established networks, the principles remain:

1. Transform paper wealth into real wealth
2. Build with community, not in isolation
3. Invest in skills as much as stuff
4. Live modestly, deploy strategically
5. Stay connected and generous

The land is waiting. The communities are forming. The transition is happening.

How will you deploy your capital—not just for your own security, but for the possibility of a world more beautiful than the one we're leaving?

Begin. 🧡
