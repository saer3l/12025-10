# Two Journeys into Shadow: Conrad's Kurtz and Shakespeare's Hal

## On the descent into darkness and the ascent to power

A companion to the essays on rooting, resilience, and wisdom

---

There is a strange kinship between Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness* (1899) and Shakespeare's *Henry IV* Parts 1 & 2 (c. 1597-1599). On the surface, they could not be more different: one, a late-Victorian novella set in the colonial Congo, probing the nature of civilization and savagery; the other, an Elizabethan history play chronicling a young prince's education in the taverns and battlefields of medieval England.

Yet both texts are, at their core, about the same journey: **the descent into a morally ambiguous underworld, the encounter with a charismatic figure who embodies transgression, and the question of whether—and how—one can return transformed but not corrupted.**

Marlow travels up the Congo River to find Kurtz, the company's most successful ivory agent who has "gone native" and established himself as a god-like figure among the indigenous people. Prince Hal descends from the royal court into the Boar's Head Tavern to befriend Falstaff, the corpulent, witty, amoral knight who represents everything the crown is not: appetite, disorder, freedom, life.

Both Kurtz and Falstaff are **magnificent corrupters**. Both offer a kind of truth unavailable in the "civilized" world. Both must be repudiated for the protagonist to return to—or ascend to—legitimate power.

And both texts force us to ask: **What is lost in that repudiation? What is the cost of returning to the light?**

## THE STRUCTURE OF DESCENT

### Marlow's Journey Up the Congo

Conrad structures *Heart of Darkness* as a journey inward and backward: Marlow travels up the river, away from the colonial stations at the coast, deeper into the jungle, further from European "civilization," closer to something primal and unspeakable.

The river is both literal and symbolic. It is a trade route for ivory extraction, and it is a descent into the human psyche, into what Marlow calls "the earliest beginnings of the world."

Each station Marlow passes is more degraded than the last:
- The **Outer Station**: incompetent, absurd, filled with dying African workers and pointless bureaucracy
- The **Central Station**: corrupt, petty, managed by the scheming Manager who wants Kurtz eliminated
- The **Inner Station**: Kurtz's domain, where European pretense has collapsed entirely into raw will and horror

By the time Marlow reaches Kurtz, he has left behind any coherent moral framework. The jungle has eroded it. What remains is only Kurtz's voice—eloquent, persuasive, monstrous—and the single page of his report for the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs, which begins with high-minded ideals and ends with the scrawled note: **"Exterminate all the brutes!"**

### Hal's Journey Into Eastcheap

Prince Hal's descent is geographic and social. He leaves the court—the site of his father King Henry IV's anxious, guilt-ridden rule—and enters the tavern world of Eastcheap, where Falstaff holds court.

Falstaff's realm is everything the crown is not:
- **Unproductive**: Falstaff lives by theft, credit, and wit, not by labor or duty
- **Embodied**: Food, drink, sex, laughter—the body's pleasures are central, not repressed
- **Improvisational**: Falstaff turns every situation into theater, mocking authority through role-play and puns
- **Amoral**: Honor, duty, obligation—Falstaff deflates them all with his famous catechism: "What is honor? A word. What is in that word honor? What is that honor? Air."

Hal does not stumble into this world accidentally. He **chooses** it. In his first soliloquy (1 Henry IV, Act 1, Scene 2), he reveals his plan:

> "I know you all, and will a while uphold  
> The unyoked humor of your idleness...  
> So when this loose behavior I throw off  
> And pay the debt I never promisèd,  
> By how much better than my word I am,  
> By so much shall I falsify men's hopes."

Hal is **slumming**. He is gathering material for his transformation. He will spend time in the underworld, learn its lessons, and then—at the moment of his choosing—repudiate it entirely and emerge as the ideal king.

This is calculated. Marlow's journey is not.

## THE MAGNIFICENT CORRUPTER: KURTZ AND FALSTAFF

Both texts give us a charismatic figure who embodies everything the "civilized" world claims to reject but secretly desires.

### Kurtz: The Eloquent Savage

Kurtz is a **genius of extraction**—of ivory, of power, of devotion. He came to the Congo as the company's golden boy, a man of culture and ideals, an ivory agent who could write eloquently about the "civilizing mission." 

But in the jungle, without the constraints of European society, Kurtz transforms into something else. He becomes a god. He conducts unspeakable rituals. He places severed heads on stakes around his compound. He takes an African woman as his consort. He writes, "Exterminate all the brutes."

And yet—Marlow cannot dismiss him. Kurtz remains **eloquent** to the end. His final words—"The horror! The horror!"—are taken by Marlow as a moment of clarity, a judgment, a moral reckoning that the "pilgrims" (Conrad's ironic term for the colonial agents) could never achieve.

Marlow says: "He had summed up—he had judged. 'The horror!' He was a remarkable man."

This is the seduction: Kurtz has descended into the heart of darkness and returned with a truth, however terrible. He has **seen** something that the comfortable, hypocritical world of European imperialism refuses to see.

### Falstaff: The Witty Nihilist

Falstaff is a **genius of subversion**—of authority, of duty, of the very language power uses to justify itself. He is fat, old, cowardly, and utterly free.

Where Hal's father King Henry IV is burdened by guilt (having usurped the throne from Richard II), Falstaff has no conscience. Where Hotspur (Hal's rival) is obsessed with honor, Falstaff mocks it. Where the tavern draws up bills, Falstaff picks pockets and runs up tabs he'll never pay.

He is also the **funniest person in the plays**, which is to say, the most alive. His language is endlessly inventive. He turns Hal's moralizing back on itself. When Hal calls him "that villainous abominable misleader of youth," Falstaff replies: "My lord, the man I know."

Falstaff offers Hal what the court cannot: **permission to be human**. To laugh, to drink, to play, to mock the pretensions of power.

And Hal loves him. In the tavern scenes, there is genuine affection. They improvise a play-within-a-play where Falstaff "plays" King Henry lecturing his son, then Hal plays the king. It's intimate, funny, and dangerous—because they are rehearsing the rejection that is coming.

Falstaff believes Hal will protect him when he becomes king. He is wrong.

## THE REPUDIATION: REJECTING THE SHADOW

Both texts climax with a rejection—a moment when the protagonist turns away from the corrupter and returns (or ascends) to the world of legitimate power.

### Marlow's Lie

Marlow does not reject Kurtz while he's alive. He remains loyal, even protective. When Kurtz tries to crawl back to the jungle in a final delirious escape, Marlow drags him back to the boat. When Kurtz dies, Marlow takes his papers, his memory, his story.

The rejection comes later, in Brussels, when Marlow visits Kurtz's Intended (his European fiancée). She asks what Kurtz's last words were.

Marlow lies. He tells her Kurtz said her name.

This lie is the repudiation. Marlow refuses to speak the truth Kurtz discovered. He **chooses civilization's comforting fictions** over the horror. He protects the Intended's innocence, and in doing so, he protects the entire edifice of European delusion about colonialism.

Conrad's narrator (the frame-tale listener) suggests Marlow's lie is necessary, even noble. But we are meant to feel its cost. Marlow returns from the Congo hollow, bitter, unable to re-enter the smug certainty of imperial Europe. He has seen the darkness, and the lie he tells to preserve civilization poisons him.

### Hal's Coronation Rejection

When King Henry IV dies, Hal becomes King Henry V. Falstaff, who has spent the entire previous scene boasting that he will now have access to unlimited power and wealth, rushes to the coronation expecting to be embraced.

Instead, the new king speaks:

> "I know thee not, old man. Fall to thy prayers.  
> How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!  
> I have long dreamt of such a kind of man,  
> So surfeit-swelled, so old, and so profane;  
> But being awaked, I do despise my dream...  
> Presume not that I am the thing I was."

It is brutal. Public. Final.

Falstaff is banished on pain of death. The Lord Chief Justice (representing law and order) is embraced. The tavern world is repudiated entirely.

Hal has completed his education. He has learned how power works from below (Falstaff's wit and subversion) and from above (his father's guilt and Hotspur's honor). Now he discards the teacher and becomes the perfect king—the one who will conquer France in *Henry V*, deliver the "band of brothers" speech, and be remembered as England's ideal.

But the play does not let us forget Falstaff. In *Henry V*, we learn that he has died of a broken heart. Mistress Quickly says: "The King has killed his heart."

The cost of power is made clear: to be the ideal king, Hal must kill the part of himself that loved, laughed, and lived in the tavern. He must become a **icon** rather than a man.

## WHAT IS LOST: THE COST OF ASCENT

Both texts force us to ask: **What is sacrificed when we reject the shadow and return to the light?**

### Conrad's Question: Complicity and Truth

Marlow's lie preserves European innocence, but it also preserves European imperialism. By refusing to tell the Intended that Kurtz's final words were "The horror! The horror!"—by refusing to name the violence, exploitation, and madness at the heart of the colonial project—Marlow becomes complicit.

The "civilized" world can continue believing its own story: that it brings light to the "dark continent," that men like Kurtz are aberrations rather than logical conclusions.

Conrad does not offer easy answers. The novella's famous ambiguity—its refusal to moralize directly—leaves us with the question: **Is civilization worth preserving if it requires lies this large?**

Some readers see Marlow's lie as compassionate. Others see it as cowardice. Conrad seems to suggest it is both, and that this ambiguity is the human condition under imperialism.

### Shakespeare's Question: Humanity and Power

Hal's rejection of Falstaff is presented as necessary. The play seems to endorse it. Order is restored. The prodigal prince becomes the ideal king. England will triumph.

But Shakespeare also gives Falstaff the last word (before his offstage death in *Henry V*): "Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound."

Even banished, Falstaff is still scheming, still alive in language, still refusing to submit to the moralism the crown demands.

And we, the audience, **mourn him**. We mourn the loss of wit, of laughter, of bodily pleasure, of the refusal to take power seriously. We mourn the part of Hal that could love a fat old knight.

The question Shakespeare poses is: **Can you be fully human and fully powerful?**

Hal chooses power. He becomes the king England needs. But he also becomes something less than he was—an icon, a function, a man who has killed his own heart to serve the state.

## WHY THIS MATTERS NOW: DESCENT AND RESILIENCE

Why read these two texts together? Why does this structure—descent, encounter, repudiation—matter to those of us building resilience in uncertain times?

Because **we are all facing the same question Marlow and Hal faced**: 

Do we tell the truth about what we've seen, even if it destabilizes the comfortable fictions that hold our world together? Or do we return to the surface, keep our heads down, and preserve the system?

Do we stay connected to the "underworld" parts of ourselves—the bodily, the playful, the subversive—or do we sacrifice them to become functional within existing power structures?

### The Conrad Question for Our Time

Climate collapse, economic inequality, the violence of extraction—these are our "heart of darkness." We have seen the horror. We know the system is not reformable. We know the cheerful techno-optimism of mainstream culture is a lie.

Do we tell the truth, even when it makes us unfit for polite company? Or do we, like Marlow, protect the innocence of those who haven't seen?

The essays in this series (*The Digital Sage*, *Three Paths, Three Lands*, *Three Buckets, Three Lands*) choose truth-telling. They say: the transition is coming. The old systems will fail. Build resilience now.

But there is a cost. To speak this way is to become marginal. To be seen as doomer, prepper, pessimist. To lose access to the comfortable consensus.

Is that a cost worth paying? Conrad doesn't answer. But he shows us what happens when we lie: we become hollow. We survive, but we are poisoned.

### The Shakespeare Question for Our Time

Can we build power—real, effective, resilient power—without sacrificing our humanity? Can we organize, strategize, and lead without becoming the very thing we oppose?

Hal becomes an effective king by rejecting Falstaff. But he also becomes cold. Calculating. Alone.

The communal resilience projects we need—land trusts, cooperatives, mutual aid networks—require *both* Hal's strategic clarity *and* Falstaff's humor, embodiment, and refusal to take authority too seriously.

If we become grim, joyless, purely instrumental in our survival strategies, we lose the very thing we're trying to preserve: a life worth living.

If we stay in the tavern forever, refusing to organize or plan, we won't survive the transition.

The wisdom is in the balance. And the tragedy is that balance is nearly impossible to maintain.

## THE LESSON: INTEGRATION, NOT REPUDIATION

What if Marlow had told the truth *and* remained compassionate?

What if Hal had become king *and* kept Falstaff close—not as licensed fool, but as trusted advisor whose wit could puncture royal pretension?

Both texts present repudiation as inevitable. Conrad's world offers no path to reform imperialism. Shakespeare's world offers no model for a king who governs with love.

But perhaps that's the work we're called to do now: **refuse the binary**.

To descend into the shadow—to see the horror, to befriend the disruptive trickster—*and then to return with that knowledge integrated, not repudiated*.

To build resilience that is:
- **Truth-telling** (like Kurtz's final judgment) *without* nihilism
- **Embodied and joyful** (like Falstaff's tavern) *without* irresponsibility
- **Strategic and powerful** (like Hal's kingship) *without* coldness
- **Compassionate** (like Marlow's loyalty to Kurtz) *without* complicity in lies

This is the work: to go into the underworld, learn its lessons, and return not to reject it but to *weave it into the fabric of the new world we're building*.

## CODA: THE RIVER AND THE TAVERN

Conrad ends *Heart of Darkness* with Marlow on the Thames, telling his story to friends who don't fully understand. The narrator notes that the river "seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness."

Shakespeare ends *Henry IV Part 2* with the new king preparing for war, Falstaff banished, order restored.

Neither ending offers resolution. Both texts leave us haunted.

Perhaps that's the gift. Not answers, but the right questions:

- Have we seen the darkness at the heart of our systems?
- Have we befriended the parts of ourselves the culture tells us to repress?
- When we build our resilient communities, will we have the courage to integrate shadow and light?
- Can we be truthful *and* kind?
- Can we be powerful *and* human?

The land is waiting. The transition is coming. The heart of darkness and the tavern both have lessons to teach.

Walk both paths. Return transformed. Build the world that integrates what both Conrad and Shakespeare could only present as tragedy.

Begin. 🧡
